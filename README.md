# Importing data to Google Cloud Firestore

# Description
Twelve years ago, Lily started the Pet Theory chain of veterinary clinics. The Pet Theory chain has expanded rapidly over the last few years. However, their old appointment scheduling system is not able to handle the increased load, so Lily is asking you to build a cloud-based system that scales better than the legacy solution.
Ruby has been hired as a consultant to help Pet Theory make the transition to serverless. After comparing serverless database options, the team decides to go with Cloud Firestore. Since Firestore is serverless, capacity doesn't have to be provisioned ahead of time which means that there is no risk of running into storage or operations limits.
